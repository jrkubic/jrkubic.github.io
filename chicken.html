						<h3>How to take care of Chicken</h3>
						<p>Chicken is a very special cat. Here is how to properly care for her:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Litterbox in the mudroom by the back door. Please clean every visit. Small trash bags are nearby in the mudroom for disposal. They can be put in a sealable bin or our dumpster.<span class="image fit"><img src="images/litterbox.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
							<li>Water bowls are near the back door. Please ensure she has clean water available.<span class="image fit slim"><img src="images/waterbowls.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
							<li>The food is on an auto timer. No need to mess with it. It pours itself at 7am and 8pm.<span class="image fit slim"><img src="images/autofeeder.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
							<li>Her treats are located in the kitchen.<span class="image fit slim"><img src="images/treats.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
							<li>There are plants in the living room and kitchen that may need watering.<span class="image fit slim"><img src="images/plants.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
							<li>There may be mail at the front door that could be brought in as well.</li>
